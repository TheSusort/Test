Assignment 8B) - Memory game
============================

(Alternatively, you can choose Assignment 8A), which is completing the jQuery course on Codecademy.)

The task is to implement the classic memory game using jQuery. 

Minimum requirements:

  * The board is n-by-n, where n is your choosing (minimum 3)
  * The deck contains unique pairs of cards (for a board of n\*n, we need n\*n/2 pairs of cards)
  * Cards are laid out in a grid face down
  * Player flips a pair of cards over. If the cards match, they stay flipped over (or disappear)
  * The game is over when all matches are found
  * Count and show on the screen the total time elapsed and the total number of flips
  * Use some animation or effect for flipping the cards

Optional extra features for pro programmers (you may select zero or more of these):

  * User can select the size of the board
  * User can select “theme” (type of card deck, e.g., fruits, cars, logos, etc.)
  * Scoreboard (data stored in MySQL)
  * Two-player mode, where the players take turns. If the two cards match, the player scores one point, and gets a bonus turn.
  * Playing against the computer in two-player mode
